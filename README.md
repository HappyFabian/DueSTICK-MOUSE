# DueSTICK-MOUSE
A Project that Converts any Arduino DUE to an Arcade Stick and a Mouse.
=======================================================================
It implements ArduinoJoystickLibrary 1.0.1 for Arduino Leonardo,Micro and DUE 
(https://github.com/MHeironimus/ArduinoJoystickLibrary)

And the Arduino Standard Library for Mouse. 

(DIGITAL INPUT ONLY, ALTHOUGH ANALOG INPUTS ARE THE SAME TO DO.)
The Joystick current configuration has 10 buttons inputs, and one X-Axis and Y-Axis.
But more buttons can be easily implemented or configured.

The Mouse simply implements the joystick input as movement for the cursor, and Button0 and Button1 for Right and Left Click.
